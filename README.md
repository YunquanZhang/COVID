# COVID
Microsimulation model of COVID-19 infections over time.

Microsimulation version of the ordinary differential equations by [Alison Hill](https://github.com/alsnhll/SEIR_COVID19). 

Predominantly uses the R package [MicSim](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MicSim/index.html) for microsimulations.

This is a simplistic model of reality and all estimates should be treated with caution.
